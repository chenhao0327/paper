# A Case of Contrast-Induced Encephalopathy Using Iodixanol
## Case study
A 70-year-old man with a history of hypertension underwent elective cardiac catheterization for ‘angina’. 
Cardiac catheterization, performed via the right radial artery, showed 80% stenosis of the (LAD).
In the same session, a ..... mm drug-eluting coronary-artery stent was successfully implanted in the LAD subtotal lesion without peri-procedural complications. 
The fluoroscopy time was 20.8 min, and 260 ml of iopamidol (Isovue®) was used. 
After the procedure, the patient developed sudden onset of visual changes. There were no focal neurological deficits. 
Bilateral horizontal nystagmus was noted after the procedure, and an emergent CT scan of the head was unremarkable.
A diffusion magnetic resonance imaging, performed after the patient was stable, did not show any abnormalities.
