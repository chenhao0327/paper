# A Case of Contrast-Induced Encephalopathy Using Iodixanol
## Case study
A 70-year-old man with a history of hypertension underwent elective cardiac catheterization for ‘angina’. 
Cardiac catheterization, performed via the right radial artery, showed 80% stenosis of the (LAD).
In the same session, a ..... mm drug-eluting coronary-artery stent was successfully implanted in the LAD subtotal lesion without peri-procedural complications. 
The fluoroscopy time was 20.8 min, and 260 ml of iopamidol (Isovue®) was used. 
After the procedure, the patient developed sudden onset of visual changes. There were no focal neurological deficits. 
Bilateral horizontal nystagmus was noted after the procedure, and an emergent CT scan of the head was unremarkable.
A diffusion magnetic resonance imaging, performed after the patient was stable, did not show any abnormalities. 

To the Editor:
Percutaneous intervention (PCI) is performed in
patients with coronary artery disease to achieve myocardial revascularization.1 Neuro-ophthalmic complications are very rare after these interventions. Bilateral ophthalmoplegia during percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) was reported in only 1 case in the literature.2 We report a patient who developed unilateral
isolated oculomotor nerve paralysis following PCI.

A 58-year-old woman who previously did not
have cardiac symptoms was admitted with angina. She had history of hypertension. She took metoprolol succinate 100 mg/d and aspirin 100 mg/d. She did not smoke cigarettes. Medical examination showed that her blood pressure was 140/80 mm Hg and pulse rate 80/min/rhythmic. Systemic examination findings were normal. Laboratory investigations were as follows: glucose 185 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) 24 mg/dL, creatinine 1.1 mg/dL, low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol 160 mg/ dL, triglycerides 163 mg/dL, high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol 38 mg/dL. Thyroid function tests were normal and hemoglobin A1C (HbA1c) was 10%. Urinary investigation showed no albuminuria and the albumin/creatinine ratio in a spot urine was 7 mg/mg creatinine. Electrocardiography showed biphasic T negativity between V2 and V6. Echocardiographic investigation revealed hypokinesia at the anterolateral segment and left ventricular concentric hypertrophy. The patient was taken to the catheter laboratory with the diagnosis of unstable angina pectoris. The right coronary artery and circumflex artery were normal, proximal of left anterior
descending (LAD) artery had 100% occlusion and slow retrograde flow from the distal side. Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty was performed to the total lesion that was at the proximal of LAD and Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) III flow was achieved. She suddenly developed ptosis of the left eye lid and diplopia after the prolonged and technically difficult angiography procedure. Ocular examination showed that she had a left partial third nerve paralysis. Her visual acuity was 6/6 in each eye and other ocular examination was normal. She had no previous ocular or neurological history, and her neurological examination was normal. Computed cranial tomography showed no focus of hematoma, and cranial magnetic resonance imaging with contrast and without contrast media did not show any pathological finding. She was followed up in our outpatient clinic for more than 2 months and still had ophthalmoplegia.

The occurrence of microembolic complications
following PCI is well documented. Although neurological complications are reported, neuro-ophthalmic complications are very rare.1-3 Bilateral ophthalmoplegia during PTCA was reported in only 1 case in PubMed. Drummond et al2 reported that a 61year-old female patient developed right partial third cranial nerve paralysis and left fourth cranial nerve palsy after PTCA to ameliorate stenosis of LAD artery. The cause of paralysis was considered as microembolic infarcts. We thought that the cause of neuro-ophthalmic complications in our case was ischemia due to microemboli. Both case presentations show that prolonged and technically difficult procedures and possibly age may increase the risk of microembolic complications. Our patient had new diagnosis of diabetes. Hypertension and diabetes may also have contributed to the risk of microemboli.4

The present case shows that potential ocular
motor deficits may occur after prolonged and technically difficult PCI. The risks of ocular motility deficits should be discussed with the patient prior to the procedure.
